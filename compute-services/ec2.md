# EC2 Instance Types

![alt text](image-5.png)

You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimized for different use cases ([AWS EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/))  
AWS has the following naming convention:  
`m5.2xlarge`  
- **m:** instance class  
- **5:** generation (AWS improves them over time)  
- **2xlarge:** size within the instance class  
<br/><br/>

- **Provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources.**  
- These instances are ideal for applications that use these resources in equal proportions, such as web servers and code repositories.  
- The **T** instance family is also referred to as burstable performance instances. These instances provide a baseline CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline at any time. For more information, see [Burstable performance instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html).

<br/>

---

## EC2 On Demand

- Pay for what you use:
  - Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
  - All other operating systems - billing per hour
- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
- No long-term commitment
- Recommended for short-term and uninterrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave

<br/>

---

## EC2 Reserved Instances

![alt text](image-6.png)

- Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
- You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
- **Reservation Period** – 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)
- **Payment Options** – No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)
- Reserved Instance’s Scope – Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)

- You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace

<br/>

![alt text](image-9.png)

---
### Convertible Reserved Instance

- Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope, and tenancy
- Up to 66% discount  
> Note: The % discounts are different over time – the exact numbers are not needed for the exam. This is just for illustrative purposes.


<br/>

---

## EC2 Savings Plans

- Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as RIs)
- Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
- Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
- Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-1)
- **Flexible across:**
  - Instance Size (e.g., m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
  - OS (e.g., Linux, Windows)
  - Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)

![alt text](image-10.png)

<br/>

---

## EC2 Spot Instances

- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
- The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure:
  - Batch jobs
  - Data analysis
  - Image processing
  - Any distributed workloads
  - Workloads with a flexible start and end time
- Not suitable for critical jobs or databases


<br/>

---

## EC2 Dedicated Hosts

![alt text](image-7.png)

- A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
- Allows you to address compliance requirements and use your existing server-bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, per-VM software licenses)
- **Purchasing Options:**
  - On-demand – pay per second for active Dedicated Host
  - Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
- The most expensive option
- Useful for software that has complicated licensing models (BYOL – Bring Your Own License) or for companies with strong regulatory or compliance needs


<br/>

---

## EC2 Dedicated Instances

![alt text](image-8.png)


- Instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to you
- May share hardware with other instances in the same account
- No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)


<br/>

---

## EC2 Capacity Reservations

- Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
- You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
- No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
- Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
- You’re charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
- Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that need to be in a specific AZ


<br/>

---

## Which purchasing option is right for me?

- **On demand**: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
- **Reserved**: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
- **Savings Plans**: pay a certain amount per hour for a certain period and stay in any room type (e.g., King, Suite, Sea View)
- **Spot instances**: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. You can get kicked out at any time
- **Dedicated Hosts**: We book an entire building of the resort
- **Capacity Reservations**: you book a room for a period with full price even if you don’t stay in it

## Price Comparison

**Example – m4.large – us-east-1**

| Price Type                             | Price (per hour)                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| On-Demand                              | $0.10                                      |
| Spot Instance (Spot Price)             | $0.038 - $0.039 (up to 61% off)            |
| Reserved Instance (1 year)             | $0.062 (No Upfront) - $0.058 (All Upfront) |
| Reserved Instance (3 years)            | $0.043 (No Upfront) - $0.037 (All Upfront) |
| EC2 Savings Plan (1 year)              | $0.062 (No Upfront) - $0.058 (All Upfront) |
| Reserved Convertible Instance (1 year) | $0.071 (No Upfront) - $0.066 (All Upfront) |
| Dedicated Host On-Demand Price         | [Varies by instance]                       |
| Dedicated Host Reservation             | Up to 70% off                              |
| Capacity Reservations                  | On-Demand Price                            |

## EC2 Spot Instance Requests

- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- Define max spot price and get the instance while current spot price < max
- The hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
- If the current spot price > your max price, you can choose to stop or terminate your instance with a 2-minute grace period.

- Used for batch jobs, data analysis, or workloads that are resilient to failures.
- Not great for critical jobs or databases

## How to terminate Spot Instances?

[Spot Instance Termination Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html)

![alt text](image-1.png)

- You can only cancel Spot Instance requests that are open, active, or disabled.
- Cancelling a Spot Request does not terminate instances.
- You must first cancel a Spot Request, and then terminate the associated Spot Instances.


<br/>

---

## Spot Fleets

- **Spot Fleets** = set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances
- The Spot Fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
- Define possible launch pools: instance type (m5.large), OS, Availability Zone
- Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose
- Spot Fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost
- Strategies to allocate Spot Instances:
  - **lowestPrice**: from the pool with the lowest price (cost optimization, short workload)
  - **diversified**: distributed across all pools (great for availability, long workloads)
  - **capacityOptimized**: pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
  - **priceCapacityOptimized** (recommended): pools with the highest capacity available, then select the pool with the lowest price (best choice for most workloads)
- Spot Fleets allow us to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price

# Placement Groups

- Sometimes you want control over the EC2 Instance placement strategy.
- That strategy can be defined using **placement groups**.
- When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:

- **Cluster**—clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone.
- **Spread**—spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ).
- **Partition**—spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka).

<br/>

## Cluster Placement Group

![alt text](image-2.png)

| Pros                                                                                                 | Cons                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Great network (10 Gbps bandwidth between instances with Enhanced Networking enabled - recommended) | - If the AZ fails, all instances fail at the same time. |

**Use case:**
- Big Data job that needs to complete fast
- Application that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput

---

## Placement Groups Spread

![alt text](image-3.png)

| Pros                                               | Cons                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| - Can span across Availability Zones (AZ)          | - Limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group |
| - Reduced risk of simultaneous failure             |                                                     |
| - EC2 Instances are on different physical hardware |

**Use case:**

* Application that needs to maximize high availability
* Critical applications where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other

---

## Placements Groups Partition

![alt text](image-4.png)
* Up to 7 partitions per AZ.
* Can span across multiple AZs in the same region.
* Up to 100s of EC2 instances.
* The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions.
* A partition failure can affect many EC2 instances but won’t affect other partitions.
* EC2 instances get access to the partition information as metadata.

**Use cases:** HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka.
