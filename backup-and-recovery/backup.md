## AWS Backup Vault Lock

- Enforce a **WORM (Write Once Read Many)** state for all the backups that you store in your AWS Backup Vault.
- Additional layer of defense to protect your backups against:
  - Inadvertent or malicious delete operations
  - Updates that shorten or alter retention periods
- Even the **root user** cannot delete backups when enabled.
